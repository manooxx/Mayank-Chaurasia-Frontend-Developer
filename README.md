I've completed this website project focused on food menu management and presentation. The goal was to create a user-friendly interface where visitors can browse through various food items and get detailed information about each item.
The website consists of a menu page where all food items are listed. Each item is clickable, and upon clicking, it opens a modal or popup displaying detailed information about that particular food item.
User experience was a primary focus throughout the project. We aimed to make it intuitive for users to explore the menu and access information about specific food items without any hassle. The modal approach for displaying details ensured a seamless browsing experience without navigating away from the main menu.
For the development, I used ReactJs for the frontend. I also utilized libraries or frameworks like tailwind for responsive design.
